Remote could be cool too, but I feel like I’d need someone to ask questions to when I’m stuck, you know?\\n\\nAnd yeah, numbers are okay. I mean, I don’t hate ‘em, but I’m not some math genius either. I just wanna be able to understand reports and spot if something’s off.

But analyzing trends? That’s where I get lost. I don’t know the right formulas or how to tell if a number is *actually* important or just random noise. That’s why I thought training might help, but I don’t wanna jump into something blind. You think accounting or auditing would value that kind of skill?',\n",

Like if someone handed me a simple report, I wouldn’t wanna freeze up trying to figure out if it’s correct or not.\\n\\nAnd honestly, I learn best by doing—like if someone shows me once and then lets me try it myself. Videos are cool, but if I don’t actually *do* it, I forget everything in two days. That’s why I’m kinda leaning toward a training that’s got practical exercises, not just theory. But again, I don’t wanna pick the wrong thing and regret it later. You think accounting or auditing would let me start with that kind of hands-on stuff?',\n",

That seems like the kind of thing every accounting job would need, right? But I’m not sure if that’s data interpretation or auditing or what. Maybe I’m overcomplicating it. Do you think a short training could cover that, or is it something you only learn on the job?',\n",

Like, I don’t wanna spend time and maybe even money on something that’s too basic or too advanced.

Like, would you want to be fully confident, or would you be okay learning some things on the job?\\n',\n",

For example, if a training program included topics like energy efficiency in circuits or renewable energy integration, would you feel confident diving in, or would you prefer starting with something more foundational?\\n\\nAnd just to clarify—when you say you’re curious about what sustainability consultants \"do all day,\" are you more interested in the day-to-day tasks (like meetings, reports, fieldwork) or the specific technical problems they solve?\\n',\n",

For example:\\n- Redesigning a circuit to cut energy waste?\\n- Troubleshooting a solar panel system’s efficiency?\\n- Or something else entirely?\\n\\n*(Also, just to confirm—when you say \"hands-on,\" do you mean in-person labs, simulations, or working with actual equipment?)*\\n',\n",

For example:\\n- A small-scale circuit, like for a household appliance?\\n- Something industrial, like a motor control system?\\n- Or maybe a renewable energy setup, like a wind turbine’s power converter?\\n\\n*(And just to wrap up—when you think about your ideal next step, would you prefer something short-term, like a workshop or demo, or are you open to a slightly longer program if it’s mostly hands-on?)*\\n',\n",
