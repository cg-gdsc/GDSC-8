    "\n",
    "The very first thing you need to do to participate in the GDSC is to sign up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the GDSC Portal's Sign-up page - [https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/](https://gdsc.ce.capgemini.com/app/). Make sure to enter your Capgemini email. The full name is not mandatory to sign up, but it is necessary to receive a certificate of completion after the challenge.  \n",

It's best to work with people in a similar timezone and with a similar motivation. If you really want to win make sure your teammates have the same goal. If you're here to learn and have fun, make sure your teammates are on the same page. Note that there can be up to 4 people in a team.\n",
