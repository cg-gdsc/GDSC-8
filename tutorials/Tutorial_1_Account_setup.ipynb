It's best to work with people in a similar timezone and with a similar motivation. If you really want to win make sure your teammates have the same goal.

    "# 6. Setting up your Mistral accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Mistral matters for GDSC 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This year we partnered with [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) - and this isn't just another tech vendor choice. Mistral is Europe's answer to Silicon Valley's and China's AI dominance, the only major European AI lab that can go toe-to-toe with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Mistral champions open-source AI and European values around data sovereignty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes this partnership special:**\n",
    "\n",
    "üá™üá∫ **European AI Leadership**: Mistral represents European excellence in AI - they're not just copying US approaches, they're pioneering their own path with multilingual models and open-source commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "ü§ù **Capgemini Strategic Alliance**: We have an official partnership with Mistral, giving GDSC participants access to cutting-edge models and potentially preferential access to new releases. This isn't just about using their API - it's about being part of the European AI ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "üåç **Perfect for Brazil**: Mistral's models excel at multilingual tasks and understand diverse cultural contexts - crucial for matching people to green jobs across Brazil's diverse regions and languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Cost & Performance**: Their model portfolio (from mistral-small for quick tasks to mistral-large for complex reasoning) lets you optimize for both quality and budget - essential skills for real consulting projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any LLM agents that you create will use Mistral models as the \"brain\" of the operation. Think of this challenge as your introduction to European AI leadership in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up your account\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To setup your account go to [mistral login page](https://v2.auth.mistral.ai/login) and log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mistral login page](../images/t1_mistral_login_page.png )\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using Mistral you will have to create an account. Use your Capgemini email. Remember to set a strong password ü§ì\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After your account is created you will receive an email from no-reply@emails.mistral.ai asking you to join your team. The email might not come right after you register and it is due to the updates between GDSC and Mistral accounts. In the email there will be a link allowing you to join our Mistral Team.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mistral email](../images/t1_join_team_mistral.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Mistral Home Page](../images/t1_mistral_home_page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To access the Mistral models you will need to generate an API key. To do that click on the \"API Keys\" under the \"Workspace\" section on the left. On the page you will be able to create new keys and see the ones that were already created. To create a new key click on \"Create new key\" on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create new API key](../images/t1_mistral_create_new_api_key.png)  \n",

    "\n",
    "![Create Key](../images/t1_mistral_create_key_menu.png)\n",

    "6. After clicking on \"Create new key\" you will get the oppurtinity to copy it and save it in some place safe. Do it because it is not possible to see the value of the key again!\n",
