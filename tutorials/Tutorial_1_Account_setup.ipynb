It's best to work with people in a similar timezone and with a similar motivation. If you really want to win make sure your teammates have the same goal. If you're here to learn and have fun, make sure your teammates are on the same page. Note that there can be up to 4 people in a team.\n",

    "* You can change language and the theme in the settings button to the left of the region\n",
    "* On the top left, you can search for services\n",

    "### 4.1. Accessing GenAI Models with AWS Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLM) are the core of the GDSC. We'll access them via AWS Bedrock. Search for Bedrock in the search bar and click on the service. Click on the button on the top left to open the panel. Your screen should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bedrock overview](../images/t1_bedrock_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Base models` lists all models that are available on AWS. For the GDSC, we gave you access to Claude 3 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. You may use other models but will have to organize access and payment to them yourself.\n",
    "The `Playgrounds` are perfect for testing out the different models. The `Chat` interface allows you to chat with the model, similar that the openAI chatGPT website. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Managing source code with AWS CodeCommit\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code is usually managed via a version control system like Git. AWS CodeCommit is a managed service that hosts secure Git repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search and navigate to the CodeCommit service to access the tutorials and code for the challenge. **As a change to the previous years you will also need the repository to submit a solution!**\n",

    "![CodeCommit overview](../images/t1_aws_codecommit.png)\n",

    "To test your code before submitting a solution, you'll need to push it to the branch `test_submission`. \n",

    "We'll show an example of how to do this in [tutorial 4](https://github.com/cg-gdsc/GDSC-7/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial_4_Submitting_Your_Solution.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Developing AI solutions with Sagemaker\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Sagemaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly. We'll use it to develop our AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 4.4. Keeping track of the costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is important to keep track of the costs of the AWS services you are using. Each teams gets a fixed budget every week. Developing **and** submitting a solution costs money. **If you spent more than your budget, you will not be able to access the services anymore for the rest of the week!** Hence, budget control is essential!\n",
