    "\n",
    "**Small model wins when:**\n",
    "- Simple extraction tasks (skills, location, yes/no questions)\n",
    "- Consistent input format\n",
    "- High-volume processing (like our 697 jobs)\n",
    "- Budget constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large model wins when:**\n",
    "- Complex reasoning required (\"Would this person from Recife be successful in this São Paulo role given the cultural differences?\")\n",
    "- Ambiguous or poorly formatted input\n",
    "- Nuanced analysis (understanding implicit requirements)\n",
    "- Multi-step logical chains\n",

    "Try these prompts and compare small vs large model responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex cultural reasoning:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"This job is in São Paulo but requires frequent travel to Amazon region. \n",

    "Analyze the cultural and practical challenges they might face.\"\n",

    "\"This job mentions 'coordinating with stakeholders across different time zones' \n",
    "and 'managing distributed teams.' What soft skills are implicitly required?\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "### The problem\n",
    "We have 697 items in our dataset. How can we categorize them efficiently without manually reading everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why traditional approaches fail\n",
    "**Regex and keyword matching** would be a nightmare here. Consider these challenges:\n",
    "- Job titles vary: \"Engenheiro de Energia Solar\" vs \"Solar Energy Engineer\" vs \"Renewable Systems Specialist\"  \n",
    "- Skills are described differently: \"2 years experience\" vs \"minimum 24 months\" vs \"experiência de 2 anos\"\n",
    "- Location formats differ: \"São Paulo, SP\" vs \"Greater São Paulo Area\" vs \"Estado de São Paulo\"\n",
    "- Requirements buried in paragraphs vs structured lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based classification** would need hundreds of if-then statements and constant maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LLM solution\n",
    "LLMs understand **semantic meaning**, not just keywords:\n",
    "- They recognize \"energia renovável\" and \"renewable energy\" as the same concept\n",
    "- They infer experience levels from contextual clues\n",
    "- They handle inconsistent formatting gracefully  \n",
    "- They can extract implicit information (e.g., senior-level roles often mention \"leadership\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### The trade-offs\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Much higher than regex, handles edge cases\n",
    "- **Cost**: API calls add up - need to optimize model choice\n",
    "- **Speed**: Slower than regex, but parallel processing helps\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Good with proper prompt design\n",
