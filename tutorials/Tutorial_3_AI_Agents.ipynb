    "## AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are intelligent systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that follows predefined rules, AI agents can adapt, learn, and work autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics of AI Agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autonomy**: They can operate independently without constant human oversight\n",
    "2. **Reactivity**: They respond to changes in their environment\n",
    "3. **Pro-activeness**: They take initiative to achieve their goals\n",
    "4. **Social Ability**: They can interact with other agents and humans\n",
    "\n",
    "### How AI Agents Differ from Traditional AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional AI**: Processes input → produces output (like a function)\n",
    "- **AI Agents**: Continuously interact with environment → make decisions → take actions → learn from results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Our AI Agent System:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language Models**: The \"brain\" that provides reasoning and language understanding\n",
    "2. **Structured Output**: Ensures consistent, processable responses using Pydantic models\n",
    "3. **Tools and APIs**: Allow agents to interact with external systems\n",
    "4. **Conversation Management**: Handles multi-turn interactions with personas\n",
    "\n",
    "In our career matching challenge, we'll use these components to create agents that can:\n",
    "- Conduct natural conversations with job seekers\n",
    "- Extract structured information from unstructured text\n",

    "## Our Core Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### PersonaInfo\n",
    "Represents information about job seekers extracted from conversations. This structured approach ensures we capture all essential details consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JobInfo  \n",
    "Contains the key requirements and characteristics of job opportunities, extracted from job descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TrainingInfo\n",
    "Describes training programs including skills acquired and proficiency levels.\n",

    "### IDList\n",
    "A simple container for lists of identifiers, used when agents need to return multiple recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Structured Output Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional AI systems, you might get responses like \"This person seems interested in environmental work and has some experience with sustainability.\" Although sentences like this hold the necessary information, it is tough to use it in a program with strict data structures. By using structured output calls, we get precise, actionable data:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PersonaInfo(\n",
    "    name=\"Maria Silva\",\n",
    "    skills=[(\"sustainability\", \"intermediate\"), (\"project_management\", \"beginner\")],\n",
    "    location=\"São Paulo\",\n",
    "    age=\"24\",\n",
    "    years_of_experience=\"2\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach enables:\n",
    "- **Consistent processing**: Every persona has the same data fields\n",
    "- **Easy matching**: We can compare skills, locations, and experience levels programmatically  \n",
    "- **Reliable integration**: Other systems can depend on the data format\n",
    "- **Quality assurance**: We can validate that all required information was captured\n",

    "# Building Your First AI Agent <a id='first-agent'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll create our first AI agents that can have conversations with job seekers (personas) and extract structured information from those conversations. This is where the magic happens - we're moving from static data processing to dynamic, intelligent interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Persona System\n",
    "\n",
    "In our challenge, \"personas\" are AI agents that represent fictional job seekers. Each persona has:\n",
    "- A unique background and career interests\n",
    "- Specific skills and experience levels  \n",
    "- Location preferences and constraints\n",
    "- Personal goals and motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to build agents that can:\n",
    "1. **Conduct natural conversations** with these personas\n",
    "2. **Extract key information** about their profiles and preferences\n",
    "3. **Match them** to appropriate jobs and training opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversation Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_conversation()` function orchestrates multi-turn dialogues with personas. It demonstrates several key AI agent principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal-oriented behavior**: The agent has a clear objective (gather specific information)\n",
    "- **Adaptive questioning**: Questions evolve based on persona responses\n",
    "- **Context management**: The agent maintains conversation history\n",
    "- **Efficiency awareness**: Limited turns prevent infinite conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversation ID\n",
    "⚠️ Important Note: There is a strict limit on the number of conversations each team can conduct with a persona. Teams are allowed up to 5 conversations per day, per persona, with each conversation capped at 20 messages. This limitation ensures fair usage, prevents brute-forcing solutions, and helps manage token consumption effectively. While this may seem restrictive, it is essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the system. **Conversation ID** was introduced for that reason. When calling the persona endpoint for the first time you will receive a conversation ID that need to be passed in the payload in order to get back to the right conversation.\n",

    "This is where our AI agents solve the core challenge: matching people to opportunities. Our matching system uses specialized agents that understand both human preferences and job requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Matching Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional job matching often relies on simple keyword matching. Our AI agent approach is far more sophisticated:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Approach:\n",
    "- Person has \"sustainability\" skill\n",
    "- Job requires \"environmental\" knowledge  \n",
    "- ❌ **No Match** (different keywords)\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Agent Approach:\n",
    "- Agent understands semantic relationships\n",
    "- Recognizes that sustainability ↔ environmental knowledge\n",
    "- ✅ **Match Found** with confidence score\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Layer Matching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system employs multiple specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Job Matching Agent\n",
    "- Analyzes persona skills vs. job requirements\n",
    "- Considers location preferences and constraints\n",
    "- Evaluates experience levels and career growth potential\n",
    "- Returns ranked list of suitable opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Training Matching Agent  \n",
    "- Identifies skill gaps between current abilities and career goals\n",
    "- Recommends learning paths to bridge those gaps\n",
    "- Considers prerequisite skills and learning progression\n",
    "- Suggests training programs that align with career objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Career Path Agent\n",
    "- Combines job and training recommendations\n",
    "- Creates comprehensive development plans\n",
    "- Balances immediate opportunities with long-term growth\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contextual Understanding**: Agents grasp the meaning behind requirements, not just keywords\n",
    "2. **Holistic Evaluation**: Multiple factors are considered simultaneously\n",
    "3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Each match is tailored to individual circumstances\n",
    "4. **Scalable Intelligence**: The same agents can handle thousands of personas efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how these matching agents work in practice:"
