    "# Tutorial 5: Optimized Multi-Agent System\n",
    "\n",
    "You crushed Tutorial 4! Your agents are working, you're seeing ~30% accuracy, and you understand the multi-agent architecture. But the leaderboard leaders are hitting 60-70%. Time to close that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's New in Tutorial 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial 4 was about **building** a working system. Tutorial 5 is about **optimizing** it for production-level performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements We're Adding:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work Type Pre-Filtering**\n",
    "- Focus on remote vs onsite work preferences\n",
    "- Filter jobs by location AND work type before LLM matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Optimization Everywhere**\n",
    "- Smarter extraction prompts that get work type preferences in one pass\n",
    "- Pre-filtering reduces LLM context from all jobs to only relevant ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision Matching**\n",
    "- Work type alignment prevents mismatches (no remote workers getting onsite-only jobs)\n",
    "- Location+work type filtering creates much better candidate pools\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Math That Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial 4 approach**:\n",
    "- Send ALL jobs to LLM for every persona\n",
    "- Large token count per matching request\n",
    "- Process all available jobs regardless of relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial 5 approach**:\n",
    "- Pre-filter to relevant jobs per persona based on work type preference\n",
    "- Reduced token count per matching request\n",
    "- Process only jobs that match work type preferences\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tutorial 4 problem**: We sent ALL jobs to the LLM for every persona, even when many were irrelevant based on work preferences.\n",
    "- Remote workers see onsite-only jobs → wastes tokens, confuses matching\n",
    "- Onsite workers see remote-only jobs → wastes tokens, confuses matching\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on analysis of the job dataset and persona preferences, we focus on two distinct work arrangements:\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Semantic matching between personas and opportunities (with pre-filtering!)\n",
    "- **Model**: Medium (needs reasoning capabilities) \n",
    "- **NEW**: Receives pre-filtered job list instead of all available jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game-Changing Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial 4 approach**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Send ALL jobs to LLM every time\n",
    "jobs_text = \"\\n\".join([f'{job_id}: {job_info.describe()}' for job_id, job_info in all_jobs.items()])\n",
    "matches = find_job_matches(persona, jobs_text)  # Large token count per call\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial 5 approach**:\n",

    "# Pre-filter to relevant jobs only\n",
    "filtered_jobs = [job for job in all_jobs if matches_work_type(persona, job)]\n",

    "matches = find_job_matches(persona, jobs_text)  # Reduced token count per call\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Cost reduction + better matches (LLM isn't confused by irrelevant options).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Pre-Filtering Works So Well\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Remote software developer in São Paulo\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without filtering**: LLM sees all jobs including:\n",
    "- Onsite construction jobs (wrong work type)\n",
    "- Remote marketing jobs (right work type, different skills)  \n",
    "- Onsite software jobs (right skills, wrong work type)\n",
    "- Remote software jobs (perfect matches!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**With filtering**: LLM sees only remote jobs:\n",
    "- Much easier to rank and choose the best matches\n",
    "- No confusion from work type mismatches\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Smart Filter Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We filter jobs using work type criteria:\n",
    "1. **Work type match**: Exact work type match (remote, onsite)\n",
    "2. **Flexible handling**: Handle 'unspecified' cases appropriately\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Dynamic Filtering Thresholds\n",
    "What if no jobs match the exact work type? Implement fallback logic:\n",
    "- First try: exact work type match  \n",
    "- Fallback 1: include 'unspecified' work types\n",
    "- Fallback 2: expand to broader matching criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Batch Interview Processing  \n",
    "Instead of interviewing personas one-by-one, can you interview multiple at once? Design a group interview prompt and measure improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Smart Caching by Similarity\n",
    "If two personas have similar profiles (same location, work type, skill level), can you reuse job matches? Build a similarity detector and cache system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: Multi-Stage Filtering\n",
    "Implement a two-stage filter:\n",
    "- Stage 1: Basic filter (location + work type) \n",
    "- Stage 2: Skills-based filter (remove jobs requiring skills they don't have)\n",
    "- Result: Even more focused job lists for LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5: Work Type Learning\n",
    "Track which work type classifications work best. Can you improve the extraction prompts based on success patterns?\n",

    "**Advanced Challenge**: Combine ALL optimizations and aim for even higher accuracy at lower cost per run.\n",
