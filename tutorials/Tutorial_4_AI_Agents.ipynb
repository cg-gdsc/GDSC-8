    "# Tutorial 4: Multi-Agent System for Smart Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, your 5-10% score from Tutorial 3 was... expected. You literally gave everyone the same 5 jobs. Time to build something that actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matching Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "To add extra clarity before you jump to work we wanted to share the basic matching rules that are used to define best matches. These rules are the baseline for decisions why certain persona is fit for a job. Although we all know that sometimes applying for a job you have no experience with could positively surprise you, **these hard filters exist for good reason**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of them as the \"minimum viable candidate\" criteria. Ignore them at your own risk - your accuracy will tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hard Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain matches the persona's target domain**.\n",
    "- **Location**:\n",
    "  - If the persona has a defined city → the job must be in the same city or remote.\n",
    "  - If the persona is \"open to relocate\" → there is no location constraint.\n",
    "- **Languages include at least one in common**.\n",
    "- **Education level** of the persona is equal to or greater than the job's requirement.\n",
    "- **Experience**: persona's years of experience are equal to or greater than the job's requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brazilian education levels** (in ascending order):\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensino Fundamental < Ensino Médio < Técnico < Tecnólogo < Graduação < Bacharelado < Licenciatura < Pós-graduação < Especialização < Mestrado < MBA < Doutorado\n",
    "\n",
    "**If any of these filters fail, the job must not be recommended.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "If a persona lacks required skills for a job:\n",
    "- The job must still be recommended (as long as it passes the hard filters).\n",
    "- Trainings must be suggested to cover all missing skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training recommendations must follow a strict level-by-level progression:\n",
    "- If the persona has no knowledge of a skill and the job requires Intermediário, suggest both Básico and Intermediário (if available in the catalog).\n",
    "- If the persona has Básico and the job requires Avançado, suggest Intermediário and Avançado (if available).\n",
    "- More generally: if the persona is at level $p$ and the job requires $r$, you must propose all trainings available from $p+1$ to $r$.\n",
    "- Missing levels in the catalog are acceptable. If no training exists for a given skill, the training list for that skill can remain empty (this is not a non-conformity).\n",
    "Skills should never be a blocker: if someone wants a job that requires a certain skill, this should not prevent those jobs from being suggested (although for a better user experience, it makes sense to prioritize them first).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trainings\n",
    "\n",
    "Trainings are available at three levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Básico → Intermediário → Avançado\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for training recommendations:\n",
    "- A persona can only benefit from trainings above their current level.\n",
    "- If the persona already knows a skill at Básico, recommend Intermediário or Avançado, but not Básico.\n",
    "- In standalone training mode (when no jobs are being recommended):\n",
    "  - Recommend only the next level above the current one.\n",
    "  - If the persona has no prior level, recommend only Básico.\n",
    "  - Do not suggest multiple levels at once in this mode.\n",
    "- Personas may seek trainings either as a standalone goal or as preparation for a job.\n",
    "- If no relevant training exists, the list may remain empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "Some personas are not yet ready for jobs or trainings. In these cases, your assistant should provide awareness content to help them explore and learn.\n",
    "Two possible cases:\n",
    "- **Too young:** If the persona is under 16, return awareness content with the reason \"too_young\".\n",
    "- **Seeking information:** If the persona is simply exploring (e.g., asking “What does an engineer do?”), return awareness content with the reason \"info\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why These Rules Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example failure**: Recommending a Doutorado-level research position to someone with Ensino Médio education.\n",
    "- **Human logic**: \"Maybe they'll accept it anyway!\"\n",
    "- **Reality**: Automatic rejection, wastes everyone's time\n",
    "- **Your score**: Takes a hit because it's an obviously bad match\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example success**: Finding a remote sustainability job for someone in a small city with environmental interests.\n",
    "- **Filters pass**: Location (remote), domain (environmental), experience level matches\n",
    "- **Result**: Realistic recommendation that could actually work"

    "## What we're building\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-agent system that:\n",
    "- **Interviews personas** to understand their background (and costs money doing it)\n",
    "- **Extracts structured data** from messy conversations into clean JSON\n",
    "- **Matches intelligently** using semantic understanding, not just keywords\n",
    "- **Handles all three types correctly** (jobs+trainings, trainings_only, awareness)\n",
    "- **Achieves 40-50% accuracy** (vs that embarrassing 5-10% from Tutorial 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality check**: This tutorial will cost you $5-10 in API credits. But you'll learn patterns worth way more than that in real consulting work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Competitive Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, everyone can do keyword matching. The teams hitting 60%+ are doing something smarter:\n",
    "- They're having actual conversations with personas\n",
    "- They're understanding context (\"I want to help the environment\" → green jobs)\n",
    "- They're catching edge cases (minors need awareness, not jobs!)\n",
    "- They're being efficient with their API calls (remember: 5 conversations/day limit per persona)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to build that. And then share tips in Teams because the best collaborator award is pretty cool too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Improvements in This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age-aware routing**: Minors (< 16) automatically get awareness type\n",
    "2. **Structured data extraction**: No more regex nightmares with Pydantic\n",
    "3. **Semantic matching**: Understanding \"sustainability\" = \"environmental\"\n",
    "4. **Training suggestions**: Worth 25% of your score - we won't ignore them!\n",

    "- **Purpose**: Convert unstructured text to structured data\n",
    "- **Model**: Small (simple structured extraction)\n",
    "- **Cost**: ~$0.001 per extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually have THREE extraction agents - think of them as specialist junior analysts:\n",
    "1. **Persona Extraction Agent**: Pulls name, skills, location from conversations\n",
    "2. **Job Extraction Agent**: Extracts requirements from job descriptions\n",
    "3. **Training Extraction Agent**: Gets skill outcomes from training programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Why three agents instead of one? Each has a specific prompt optimized for its data type. It's like having specialists who know exactly what to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of extraction agents is we can use a cheap model - it's just pattern matching and structuring, not complex reasoning. Save the expensive models for when you actually need intelligence.\n",

    "### The Magic of .structured_output()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the game-changer. Instead of this nightmare:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Old way - pray the LLM formats correctly\n",
    "response = agent(\"Extract the skills...\")\n",
    "# Now parse the string and hope it's valid JSON...\n",
    "# Handle 17 different ways the LLM might format it...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# New way - guaranteed valid Pydantic model\n",
    "result = agent.structured_output(output_model=PersonaInfo, prompt=prompt)\n",
    "# result is ALWAYS a valid PersonaInfo object!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why .structured_output() is perfect for our problem:**\n",
    "- Forces the LLM to return data that matches our Pydantic schema exactly\n",
    "- No more regex parsing, no more \"hope it's valid JSON\"\n",
    "- If a field is missing, Pydantic uses the default value\n",
    "- Type validation built-in (can't put a string where we expect a list)\n",
    "- **100% consistent output structure** - crucial when processing 100 personas\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the difference between a hackathon project and production code."

    "## What You Just Built\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats! You went from random matching (5%) to intelligent AI agents (40-50%). That's real progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Multi-agent system** with specialized roles (like a real consulting team)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Semantic matching** that actually understands context\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Cost optimization** using appropriate models (small for simple, large for complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **40-50% accuracy** (vs that embarrassing 5-10% from Tutorial 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Score Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you got 40-50%**: Great! The agents are working. Your semantic matching is solid.\n",
    "- **If you got 20-30%**: Check your conversation quality. Are personas actually answering your questions?\n",
    "- **If you got <20%**: Something's broken. Check extraction, check matching logic, check everything.\n",
    "- **If you got >60%**: Share your secret sauce in Teams! Seriously, help others and maybe win that collaborator award.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Track your costs** - Set a budget and stick to it\n",
    "2. **Share knowledge** - The Teams channel is there for a reason\n",
    "3. **Experiment boldly** - Try different approaches, compare scores\n",
    "4. **Help others** - Best collaborator award is as cool as winning\n",
    "5. **Have fun** - You're building AI agents that help people find green jobs. That's pretty awesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "See you in Tutorial 5, where we'll push for 70%+ with advanced techniques! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Bad code that ships > Perfect code that doesn't. You shipped. You improved. You're already ahead of most.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Model Optimization\n",
    "Try using small models for everything. How much do you save? How much does accuracy drop? The answer might surprise you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Better Interviews\n",
    "Design interview questions that get all info in 2 turns instead of 5. Compound questions are your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Semantic Caching\n",
    "If two personas have similar profiles, can you reuse recommendations? This could cut costs by 60-70%!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: Training Paths\n",
    "Instead of individual trainings, recommend learning paths (sequences of trainings). Much more useful for career progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Share your improvements in Teams! The best optimization wins eternal glory (and maybe some swag). 🚀"
